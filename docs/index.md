You can check their documentation [here](https://moodle.org/).

This documentation was created with the goal in mind of providing an acessible way of referencing but also adding new documentation upon expansion of the site. Moodle can work on multiple platforms. This documentation is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/monash-ma/moodle-template), where you can push for new improvements and report bugs.
